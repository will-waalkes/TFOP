Hi Karen,

I analyzed LCO CTIO 1-m Ic band data on TIC 348538431 taken 03/26/2019.

I ran an MCMC fit with t0 and Rp/R* free parameters and got the following:
Rp/R* = 0.2676 +/- 0.0008
t0 = 2458568.551559 +/- 0.000113  [BJD]

The aperture radius was 11 pixels, or 4.28". The FWHM was 2.11"


Let me know if there’s anything else I can provide!

Cheers,
Will
