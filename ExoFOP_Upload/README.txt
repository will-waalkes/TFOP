The approach is simple:
1) Place this script in a folder with the files you want to upload.
2) Edit the few parameters at the top of the code (you must add the TOI number). If there is no TOI number, enter -1 instead. Yuu should have pre-edited your username and password.
3) Make sure your files are named as specified below.
4) Run the script. In Windows, this is done by simply double-clicking the python script file (after associating it with your python executable).
5) The matching files in the directory will be uploaded and the observation summary will be added to ExoFOP. Files that don't match will be ignored.
6) Check the associated ExoFOP-TESS page to make sure the upload worked, including the observation summary.
