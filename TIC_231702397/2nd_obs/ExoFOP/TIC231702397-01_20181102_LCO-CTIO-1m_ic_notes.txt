Hi Karen,

I analyzed LCO CTIO 1-m Ic band data on TIC 231702397 taken 11/03/2018.

I ran an MCMC fit with t0 and Rp/R* free parameters and got the following:
Rp/R* = 0.0537 +/- 0.0017
t0 = 2458425.60336098 + 0.00175721 - 0.00182727  [JD]

This fitted mid-transit time is 4-sigma away from the anticipated mid-transit time based on the alert ephemeris.


Let me know if there’s anything else I can provide!

Cheers,
Will
