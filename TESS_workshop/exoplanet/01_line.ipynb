    "\n",
    "1. Try initializing the parameters using the `testval` argument to the distributions. Does this improve performance in this case? It will substantially improve performance in more complicated examples.\n",
    "2. Try changing the priors on the parameters. For example, try the \"uninformative\" prior [recommended by Jake VanderPlas on his blog](http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/06/14/frequentism-and-bayesianism-4-bayesian-in-python/#Prior-on-Slope-and-Intercept).\n",
    "3. Try re-running your code using a `pm.Deterministic` node to track the value of $\\Sigma_M$ itself. This isn't so useful in this case, but you'll see that deterministic nodes can come in very handy later.\n",
    "4. Try including a mixture model to handle outliers. See [my blog post](https://dfm.io/posts/mixture-models/) for more info about what this model looks like.\n",
    "5. Incorporate the uncertainties on radius. This can be handled by [analytically marginalizing over the \"true\" radius and mass](https://dfm.io/posts/fitting-a-plane/) or by directly fitting for the true mass and radius of each planet by including these as parameters in the PyMC3 model. The benefit of using PyMC3 is that it should be able to handle large numbers of parameters for exactly this type of problem.\n",
