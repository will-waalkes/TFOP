# Box Least Squares (BLS) Tutorial

*Based on work by [Daniel Foreman-Mackey](https://twitter.com/exoplaneteer), [Christina Hedges](TheChedgehog), [Zé Vinícius](https://twitter.com/mircaze),  and collaborators.*

In this tutorial, we will demonstrate the usage patterns for the brand new `astropy.stats.bls` package to identify transiting planet candidates in TESS light curves. If you are already familiar with AstroPy and the BLS algorithm, you may prefer to head straight to the [AstroPy BLS documentation](http://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/stats/bls.html). If Python or BLS are new to you, this tutorial will provide you with step-by-step instructions to get started.
